### What is a tool ISTP?
```
It is an abbreviation of the word (Speed Test Ping).
The tool scans your Internet through the following processes:

2- [Upload] checks the Internet upload coming from your device or transmission on two scales [Mbps][MB/s].
3- [Ping] means a network utility that indicates the signal sent over the network to another computer, and then sends its own signal again. This signal, which is measured in milliseconds (ms), lets you know how long it takes for a data packet to travel from your computer to a server on the Internet and vice versa and is measured in [ms].

5- [SPONSOR] displays the service provider provided by commercial and government companies.
6- [ISP] Shows the name of the Internet service provider you are using.
7- [Country] The name of the country in which the Internet speed test was performed is displayed.
8- [URL] It gives a direct link or snapshot of an internet speed check from the website (Speet Test) that you can use to test your download speed directly.
9- [Hosted By] Shows the name of the organization or server hosting the speed test.
10- [Packet Loss] It expresses the percentage of packets that are lost during the ping process.
11- [Server ID] Each test server is known by a unique identifier, which is useful when deciding which server you want to use.
12- [ISP Rating] Some tools can provide a rating of the service provider based on connection performance, giving a general idea of the quality of service provided.
